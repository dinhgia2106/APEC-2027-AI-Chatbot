    "introduction": "The Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) is a regional economic forum established in 1989 to leverage the growing interdependence of the Asia-Pacific. APEC's 21 members aim to create greater prosperity for the people of the region by promoting balanced, inclusive, sustainable, innovative and secure growth and by accelerating regional economic integration. APEC ensures that goods, services, investment, and people move smoothly across borders. Members facilitate trade through streamlining customs procedures at borders; fostering more favorable business environments; and coordinating regulations and standards across the region. It is the only global intergovernmental forum in the world committed to reducing barriers to trade and investment without legally binding obligations. APEC achieves its goals by promoting dialogue and arriving at decisions on a consensus basis, and it gives equal weight to the views of all members.",
    "mission": "APEC’s mission is to achieve sustainable economic growth and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region. Members are united in a drive to build a dynamic and harmonious Asia-Pacific community by championing free and open trade and investment; promoting and accelerating regional economic integration; encouraging economic and technological cooperation; enhancing human security; and facilitating a favorable and sustainable business environment. The initiatives help turn policy goals into concrete results and agreements into tangible benefits for the region.",
    "vision_2040": "The Putrajaya Vision 2040, which outlines APEC’s vision for the next 20 years, was adopted at the 2020 APEC Economic Leaders’ Meeting (AELM). The vision aims to achieve “an open, dynamic, resilient and peaceful Asia-Pacific community by 2040, for the prosperity of all our people and future generations.” APEC members will endeavor to achieve this vision by pursuing three economic drivers: trade and investment; innovation and digitalization; and strong, balanced, secure, sustainable and inclusive growth.",

        "strategic_analysis": "South Korea's removal of most COVID-19 related restrictions and the requirement of only a new e-Arrival card indicates a return to full normalization in international travel, while adopting digital measures for more efficient passenger information management. The elimination of strict health screening measures (vaccinations, testing) shows a complete reopening of borders and confidence in managing public health without stringent travel restrictions. The introduction of the e-Arrival card, while a new step, is a digital administrative measure rather than a health screening one. This indicates that South Korea has transitioned from a pandemic-response travel framework to a more streamlined, digitally-supported immigration process."
